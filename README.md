# PHP-PayPal-IPN
PHP Class for verifying PayPal Instant Payment Notification (IPN) messages.  
Use the `PaypalIPN` class in your project to handle the encoding of POST data, post back to PayPal, and parsing of the response from PayPal.

To install this package using composer:

    composer require overint/php-paypal-ipn

Example Use Case
---------

    use overint\PaypalIPN;
    
    $ipn = new PaypalIPN();
    $ipn->useSandbox();
    $verified = $ipn->verifyIPN();
    if ($verified){
    	//process IPN
    }
  
  Features
--------

* Switch between live and sandbox by  using the `useSandbox` function.
* Verifies an HTTP "200" response status code from the PayPal server.
* Throws various exceptions to differentiate between common errors in code or
  server configuration versus invalid IPN responses.


Getting Started
---------------

This code is intended for web developers. You should understand how the IPN
process works conceptually and you should understand when and why you would be
using IPN. Reading the [PayPal Instant Payment Notification Guide][1] is a good
place to start.

You should also have a [PayPal Sandbox Account][2] with a test buyer account and
a test seller account. When logged into your sandbox account there is an IPN
simulator under the 'Test Tools' menu which you can used to test your IPN 
listener.

Once you have your sandbox account setup, you simply create a PHP script that
will be your IPN listener. In that script, use the `PaypalIPN` class as shown
above in the example use case.
